# For our project, we are going to navigate through the list of Billboard songs TOP 100. The URL is going to be this one: 
http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100 

-The data we are interested in is the TITLE OF THE WEBSITE, DATE ACCESSED, SONG NAME, THE ARTIST OF THE SONG, and THE NUMBER the song was that week. We are going to be working with these three columns to yield interesting results by looking at the same webpage almost every day.

-Some of the queries that we plan to support are basically to see how many times in the past month was that specific artist in the top 100, or what song had the most weeks in the top 5 positions. Also, how many songs of that specific artists were in the top 20 for that specific month.  Or what was the song that suffered the highest decrease in the time frame we are using it to check. Those are examples of some of the interesting information that we could look up regarding the music popularity and the artists success throughout time.
